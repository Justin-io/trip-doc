        Respected Madam,

    <div class="section justify">
        I am writing to respectfully request your permission to participate in the <strong>'AI FOR ALL'
            Ideathon</strong> organized by the Tata Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at

    <div class="section justify">
        My team and I have developed a project titled <strong>"AgriShield"</strong>, which addresses the "Reaction Time
        Crisis" in Global Agriculture. Our solution transforms agricultural defense from reactive to "Autonomous &
        Proactive" by utilizing AI and IoT to validate threats and intervene immediately. This project aligns with the
        "Precision Agriculture" thrust area of the hackathon.
    </div>

    <div class="section justify">
        In order to complete the registration process, we are required to submit a <strong>Bonafide Certificate of
            Nomination</strong> signed by the Head of the Institution.

    <div class="section justify">
        I kindly request you to grant us permission to attend this prestigious event and to issue the necessary Bonafide
        Certificate. I assure you that we will abide by all the rules and regulations of the college and the event
        organizers.
