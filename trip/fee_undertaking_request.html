    </div>

    <div class="section" style="text-align: justify;">
        I am writing to respectfully inform you that I have collected the original fee structure certificate from the
        college office today, 27.01.2026. This document is explicitly required by my bank to process the release of the
        tuition fee for the current academic year.
    </div>

    <div class="section" style="text-align: justify;">
        I will be submitting this document to the bank immediately. However, as per standard banking procedures, it will
        take approximately 3-4 working days for the transaction to be processed and for the full fee amount of Rs.
        32,500/- to be credited to the college account.
    </div>

    <div class="section" style="text-align: justify;">
        In light of this, I humbly request you to kindly accept this letter as my undertaking and grant me permission to
        participate in the scheduled Industrial Visit (IV). I sincerely assure you that the fee payment will be settled
        instantly once the loan amount is disbursed by the bank. I request your kind consideration in this matter so
        that I do not miss this important academic activity.

    <div class="section">
        Thanking you,

        Yours faithfully,
